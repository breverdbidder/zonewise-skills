# ⚠️ DEPRECATED

This repository has been **archived** and replaced by:

## 👉 [zonewise-lobster](https://github.com/breverdbidder/zonewise-lobster)

The new repository uses **Moltbot Lobster** for deterministic, approval-gated workflows that address security concerns identified in the [Vibe Code Guild analysis](https://github.com/moltbot/moltbot/discussions/security).

### Why the change?

| Old Approach | New Approach |
|--------------|--------------|
| Non-deterministic LLM routing | Typed YAML pipelines |
| Same command → different results | Deterministic execution |
| Prompt injection risk | Approval gates halt before actions |

**Do not use this repository.** All development has moved to zonewise-lobster.
